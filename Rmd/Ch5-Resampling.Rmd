## Bootstrapping
The bootstrap involves resampling with replacement from your sample. Effectively you treat your sample as a representation of the population and the generate more samples by selecting from it.  
Generally used to get a better idea of the distribution of a parameter. For example: your sample might have a mean of 80. If you generate 1000 bootstrapped samples from that sample then their mean will vary slightly around 80. The size of this variance around 80 gives you an idea of the standard error of the mean.


## Cross Validation
Split your data into k folds. Train your model on all but 1 fold, assess it on the held out fold. Repeat this for each fold in turn, then average out the errors.  
Typical values of k are 5 or 10.
